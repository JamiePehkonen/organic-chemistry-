        <p class="main">
        Organic chemistry is a branch of chemistry that studies the structure, composition and reactions of chemical compounds that contain carbon atoms. It’s considered to be a foundational science for many fields such as medicine, pharmaceuticals and biochemistry because it builds a strong foundational understanding of chemical principals.   
        </p>
        <p class="main">
         Carbon atoms have the ability to form stable bonds with other carbon atoms in various forms. The study of organic chemistry encompasses a wide array of molecules ranging from simple hydrocarbons which contain hydrogen and carbon atoms, to more complex makeups such as those found in DNA. 
        </p>
        <p class="main">
        Once the functional groups of a substance are known, chemists are able to perform synthesis. Synthesis refers to the process of designing and creating new compounds and structures  through various chemical reactions in order to produce a new compound. The process starts with simpler compounds, but once the process is complete, a new more complex compound is formed. Synthesis is used in the creation of new pharmaceuticals.
