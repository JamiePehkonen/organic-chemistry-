            The law of Conservation of mass states that when a chemical reaction takes place, mass is neither created or destroyed during the process. Instead the mass can take on a new form.  This in turn means that the total mass of the reactants is equal to the total mass of the products. 
        </p>

            The law was first demonstrated by Antoine Lavoisier in 1789. He demonstrated that matter could not be created or destroyed during chemical reactions. He proved this law by measuring the mass of reactants and products in sealed containers to show that the atomic mass remained consistent. His discovery was also aided by an experiment done with metals, during a chemical reaction the mass gained by a metal during a chemical reaction was equivalent to the mass in the surrounding air.

            One example of this law can be seen in the image above, we start with 4 hydrogen atoms and 2 oxygen atoms. During a reaction they combined and formed water. No new molecules were created during the process. However, the atoms instead rearranged to make a new compound. As seen the mass of the reactants is equivalent to the mass of the products of the reaction.
