           The Curtin- Hammett Principle is a principle in physical organic chemistry which states that a reaction with a pair of either reactives or reactive intermediates that interconvert will yield a product ratio that is dependent on the difference of energy between the two conformers and energy barriers. The model also shows that the product distribution will not reflect the distribution of the intermediates.

              The model is used to explain selectivity of regioselective reactions. This is demonstrated through the relationship of the constants and the equilibrium constant represented by the Winstein-Holness equation which is an  equation explaining how fast reversible reactions(A—B) lead to two new irreversible reactions.  (A–C, B–D).
            </p>

            <p>The model was proposed by  David Yarrow Curtin and Louis Plack Hammett in 1950 who cited the prior mentioned Winstein-Holness equation to explain the difference of energy during a chemical reaction</p>
